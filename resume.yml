        - "<strong>Multi-Tenant IP Access Switch Quick Check</strong>: Quickly determines whether multiple tenant devices are on the same access switch subnet to expedite network issue troubleshooting."
        - "<strong>Physical Link Quality Check within POD</strong>: Monitors the physical link status of single tenant devices, including access switch, SDN gateway, core switch transmission indicators like RX/TX optical power, CRC checks, and bandwidth usage to ensure link quality."
        - "<strong>Core Network Physical Link Quality Check</strong>: Inspects key indicators such as CRC, optical power, and interface bandwidth percentage of core devices, ensuring no abnormalities in the core links."
        - "<strong>User-Friendly Frontend Interface</strong>: Uses AlpineJS and TailwindCSS to customize component styles, offering an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for end users."

      type: Development/Deployment
      start: 03 / 2024
      end: Now
      summary: Developed an automated monitoring and data collection tool for router, etc. devices for inspection based on the <code>SNMP</code> protocol. The tool adapts to multiple vendor outputs, collects equipment status, organizes it into Excel spreadsheets, and provides differential reports compared to historical data.

      highlights:
        - "<strong>Customizable Inspection Items</strong>: Allows users to set inspection items through configuration files based on actual needs. Users can specify device types, IP lists, and <code>SNMP OIDs</code> to adjust the content and output of inspections."
        - "<strong>Pre-Check of Host Status</strong>: Establishes different pre-check logic according to device types. Uses <code>ICMP</code> and <code>TCP</code> methods to check the host's live status, ensuring that detailed inspections are only performed on online devices, thereby improving script execution efficiency."
        - "<strong>Encapsulated Command-Line Interface</strong>: Provides rich command-line options and parameters, allowing users to directly invoke the tool for inspection tasks."
        - "<strong>Multi-threaded Execution</strong>: Utilizes multi-threading technology with a thread pool to handle multiple inspection tasks simultaneously, significantly improving efficiency."
        - "<strong>Systemd Service Unit Configuration</strong>: Configures the tool as a <code>systemd</code> service unit for automatic startup, service status monitoring, and log management."
